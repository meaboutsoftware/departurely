## How to start?

If you would like to start working with this project, there are several points to follow:

. Let me know that you are willing to add or edit existing code - this way I can add you to contributors.
. Download your favorite IDE :)
. Install `+Node.js 14.6.0+` or newer.
. Clone the repository.
. Run `+npm install+` to get all node packages.
. Create your own `+.env.local+` file in the root of the project. Next, add this variable: `+API=http://transport.opendata.ch/v1+`
. Run `+npm run dev+`
. Open `+http://localhost:3000+`. Note that the port might differ (especially if you run another process that uses port `+:3000+`).
. You should see the main page that contains search form.
. As there is no auto-suggestion for places in Switzerland, you have to type it manually. You can type whatever city in Switzerland, e.g. type _Wil_ to _from_ field and _Geneve_ to _to_ field.
